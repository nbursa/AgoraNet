The host shares the room link with others, who can join as guests without registering, optionaly making username. Votes, audio, and shared content are transmitted directly between participants — with no central control, no login requirement for guests, and no tracking. Everything — including discussions, voting, and file sharing — stays on participant devices and is never stored on external servers."
