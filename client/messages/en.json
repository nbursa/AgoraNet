      "text": "You can create an account using only an anonymous username and secure it locally with a password. When you create a room, you automatically become the host. The host shares the room link with others, who can join as guests without registering, optionaly making username. Votes, audio, and shared content are transmitted directly between participants — with no central control, no login requirement for guests, and no tracking. Everything — including discussions, voting, and file sharing — stays on participant devices and is never stored on external servers."
